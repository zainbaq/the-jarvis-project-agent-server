Powered by AI Carmine\\'s in Times Square garners attention for its heaping, family-style dishes that both delight and overwhelm diners with their size, occasionally leading to food waste. While the bustling atmosphere and prime location draw in crowds, particularly theatre-goers, guests have called out the potential for long waits, even with reservations. The service at Carmine\\'s earns praise for being warm and efficient, adding value to the dining experience, which is seen as reasonably priced for the heart of New York City, despite the occasional noise level impacting the ambiance.

Great atmosphere; although only 35 years old, the place is decorated with old photographs and paintings that make you feel like it\\'s early 1900\\'s. We had been advised by friends about the size of Carmine\\'s servings, so we ordered one Caesar salad and one entree of pasta marinara (about $33 each). Huge, family-style portions; both would have served at least six people, and delicious too. Service was good, the staff sang Happy Birthday to our granddaughter, gave her a slice of cheese cake, and we were at The Lion King by 6:45. Very good experience. Would definitely go again.

Carla S 6 contributions 0 5 of 5 bubbles Favorite Review Great food atmosphere and staff highly recommended ! Mar 2025 • couples This was a last minute decision to go but definitely the best one. Even at 6.30 on Monday evening the place was full and buzzing. To save a wait we agreed to eat at the bar upstairs and was served by the charming miguel who gave us the history of the restaurant and explained about the huge portion sizes . We were not disappointed they were huge ! but very tasty and we could have easily fed 4 of us. Miguel even had the waiters sing happy birthday to my husband and was thoroughly professional and friendly ! what more could you want delicious food, great atmosphere and even better staff all for a good price. We would highly recommend this restaurant for a great experience all round ! thank you so much we won’t forget you !

Merryheart Singapore 9050 contributions 0 4 of 5 bubbles Hearty Italian fare in Times Square Mar 2025 • family Ambience: Carmine\\'s offers a lively and inviting atmosphere, with a touch of classic elegance. The beautifully decorated space features chandeliers, wall paintings, wooden furniture, and a huge bar counter, creating a sophisticated yet welcoming vibe. Frank Sinatra\\'s timeless tunes added a nostalgic charm to our dining experience. Despite being lunch hour, the noise level was pleasantly low, allowing for engaging conversations. Service: The staff at Carmine\\'s were friendly and attentive, ensuring we felt well taken care of throughout our meal. Bread Basket: The assortment of bread included slices of rustic Italian bread (possibly ciabatta or pane casareccio) and pieces of focaccia. My favorite was the Sicilian-style focaccia or sfincione, topped with tomato sauce and herbs. Menu: Carmine\\'s boasts a wide variety of appetizers, salads, raw bar, pasta, chicken, veal, seafood, steak, vegetables, sides, and desserts. Each dish on the menu is designed to serve 3-5 people, a unique concept that\\'s perfect for group dining. We opted for the Shrimp Parmigiana, one of Carmine\\'s favorites, with an option to add pasta for $13.50. The portion sizes are truly American - impossible for a single diner to finish! Shrimp Parmigiana: • 12 big shrimps covered in cheese, sitting on a bolognese-like sauce • Shrimps were fresh with a savoury-sweet taste and a crunchy, springy texture • Sauce was a bit salty but paired well with the bread • Flavourful with a rich impact Price: While the prices per dish are hefty, the generous serving sizes make it reasonable for group dining. Verdict: A fantastic experience enjoying authentic Italian food at Times Square. Will I return? Absolutely, to try out other dishes! Just a suggestion to the restaurant: consider offering half the serving size at half the price. It would be great to have two different serving sizes for groups of five people and below.

Bub1958 Stillwater 93 contributions 0 5 of 5 bubbles Get a reservation way in advance Dec 2024 • couples We heard this place was always busy so we made a reservation two weeks in advance and still could only get a 2:30 time. We were seated on time though, and the food and service was excellent. For most entrees one order feeds two people, and the salads feed about four. Prices were reasonable for NYC, so with one cocktail, 1/2 entree and a split salad figure about $50 per person before tax and tip. My only criticism is that they pack the tables in too tight, so there\\'s not much room to maneuver.

Feb 2024 • family How wonderful this restaurant is!!! I would say it\\'s the famous \"BBB\" in NY! good food, fair price and wonderful presentation! We booked the table very easily on their website and at the agreed time, we arrived and sat down. Going there at peak times for a meal means you have to wait a long time because the daughter is really big and the restaurant is very full! The waiter is very friendly, he explained to us calmly and in detail how the restaurant and the dishes work. We liked it so much that we went twice The dishes we ordered serve 3 people, are very large and well served. For each dish like the one in the photo it cost $55 and $58, and a pizza at the hotel that didn\\'t have 8 pieces cost $45 and we still left hungry, just to give you an idea. There\\'s plenty of water at the table too. A very welcoming environment, we loved it and will come back again Read more Written April 28, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Claudia J 8 contributions 0 3 of 5 bubbles I wouldn\\'t do it if I were you! Sep 2024 • family I attended the Murder Mystery dinner with my daughters to celebrate my bday. We were told a drink was included in the hefty price only to be charged for the drinks after the fact. The prefixed menu is very basic to be shared with the table. BEWARE of when they encourage \"crowd participation.\" When you get up to participate, they throw your food out! So basically we paid all that money & didn\\'t get to eat & went home hungry! I\\'ve been calling since Sept to relay my disdain for not being allowed to either finish eating or take it to go. The general manager, Carolyn, promised me a gift card of \"unknown\" amount back in Sept & still has not mailed it to me! I DO NOT recommend this place... A lot of money was spent for poor service!

Lonneke I Panheel 19 contributions 0 2 of 5 bubbles Lots of waste... Apr 2024 • friends What seemed to be a pleasant evening ended with disappointment for us. We were kindly received and there was a nice atmosphere in a busy and overcrowded restaurant. Service was very friendly and gave us advice about the options for ordering from a menu. With the starter we discovered that the portions were enormous, we asked to halve our portion (in size, not in finances) to prevent waste. This was not possible. So it was with quite some reluctance that we received the 2nd course. The tables next to us, with 5 people, received the same portions. So it was completely out of proportion The idea that there is so much waste has disappointed us. In the end we took a doggy bag with us and made someone happy with it on the street. It wasn\\'t what we expected. Shame! Read more Written April 22, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Sao Paulo 8 contributions 1 2 of 5 bubbles Terrible service Dec 2023 • family The restaurant has delicious food and very cheap portions in relation to the size. However, it still doesn\\'t change the fact that it is an extremely busy restaurant, we waited more than 2 hours, there were even tables the same size as ours (4) who arrived later and were seated before even without a reservation. I can\\'t speak about the service in general, but I don\\'t think ours was good, as it was our first time going to the place we didn\\'t know the size of the portions and we told the waiter about it, but he still let us order a lot of things, but a lot (we always asked if it was a lot and/or if it would be enough). Maybe if you go to the place knowing the size of the portions and the delay, you can have a great experience mainly because of the food, but in this case the wonders they serve were erased by the delay and the sloppy service. If you go there, I highly recommend booking in advance and not ordering too much, as the portions are large (1 dish and 1 starter is more than enough for a family of 4).

Gabriel R 1 contribution 0 3 of 5 bubbles Good but with caveats May 2024 • family The atmosphere is really cool, very “American” but we didn\\'t have a good experience and the food isn\\'t really worth it. We arrived at the restaurant because we had a reservation and they asked us to wait at the bar. We saw that people were ordering food so we went with the flow. After about 15 minutes they informed us that our table was free, but as we had ordered food at the bar we missed the opportunity to sit at the reserved table and had to stay at the bar. It was just my wife and I, and as there was a lot of food, I didn\\'t think it was worth it. We ordered pasta and chicken parmigiana. The taste also doesn\\'t compare to what we eat at, for example, Olive Garden. Anyway, I think that if it\\'s a family, 4 or more, it might be worth it. Otherwise I don\\'t recommend it.

Marn67 Huddersfield 89 contributions 0 3 of 5 bubbles Huge portions but overrated Aug 2024 • couples Work colleague recommended Carmine\\'s, which is said to be a NYC institution. The portions are huge and we noticed that many diners were taking away doggy bags following their meal. Our waiter was not speedy or attentive and I think he was more interested in looking after the bigger tables, not my wife and I. However, he did point out that we might not need a full portion each, which was a good call as we could not finish the one course, single portion meal (Ragu) we ordered. Massive portion of pasta uneaten and we could not attempt a dessert. Great atmosphere, average food, quantity not quality. Good, but we have better Italian restaurants close to where we live in the North of England. There must be better Italian food in NYC... Not bad, but not special. One plus is we only needed the one portion of food between us, so not an expensive night because we didn\\'t have wine. Wine would have added $40-60 USD to the bill.

Nov 2024 • couples Fantastic rustic Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is amazing, food is lovely, proper old style cooking. (Do not expect the a la cart style taste of cooking as this is not that type of restaurant) staff were brilliant, even tho it was soo busy it still felt nice and relaxed. Would definitely recommend for a family or large family. Not ideal for couples (went with my partner) unless you’re going for one dish as portions are for 3/4 people (we ordered 2 dishes and was no were near finishing 😂). The atmosphere is worth going for alone tho. Read more Written November 22, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Дмитрий В Minsk 4 contributions 0 1 of 5 bubbles When I fell for the rating and the number of reviews, but they seem to have been bought. May 2024 • couples My wife and I stopped at Time Square and were looking for somewhere to have dinner nearby. We bought it because of the high rating and 13,000+ reviews. Full landing. There\\'s a queue. The waiter was polite and introduced himself. Didn\\'t even come up anymore. The cooks brought out the food. Only three people. Who should I tip? This is the first time this has happened to three different people taking care of you. Service is bad. Now about the food. There is no information about serving size, they bring you a real bowl of food. Servings for 4 people and very expensive. Two people, much less one, cannot eat this. They simply sell you three times more food than you can eat. Salad - a bunch of chopped vegetables, covered in mayonnaise. No taste, no aesthetics. Pasta is another bowl of food for 4. Ballonesa is sour, there is no greenery. When they asked for parmesan for sprinkling (which is always included with olive oil in real Italian restaurants), they grimaced and reluctantly brought it. And all this disgusting service and food cost 120 dollars. I definitely don\\'t recommend it. And if you decide, take into account the serving size!

They’re not interested in giving you a good experience. Smaller parties will be rushed in and out to accommodate larger ones. Food was very good. The service at my table was awful.

Oct 2024 • couples Already at the door we were greeted by a friendly gentleman. We had no Reservation and the restaurant was full but he gave us the opportunity to eat at the bar.

The only shortcoming is that there is no option to order only 1/2 dose or even 1/4 dose. There were two of us there, then they can imagine how much more food we took with us. Therefore 4/5 stars ⭐️ Read more Automatically translated Written October 8, 2024 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Dishes cost around US$40 and feed up to 3 people. The service is very efficient and fast. Great service, hot food and very well prepared. The atmosphere is very pleasant, always full. It has many tables and a beautiful counter where customers can chat and drink great drinks. If possible, make a reservation. Or wait around 30 minutes for a table.

Midtown This is the iconic New York that so many visitors imagine before they visit - spectacular skyscrapers like the Chrysler Building and Empire State Building, iconic public buildings like Grand Central Terminal and the New York Public Library, and the non-stop hustle and bustle of the city streets. Fifth Avenue is a shopper\\'s paradise where you can find every kind of store imaginable, with fashion brands ranging from the affordable to the ultra-fancy. Visit Rockefeller Center to experience towering Art Deco grandeur, and foodies will love the busy restaurants that stay open late in Koreatown. After dark, Midtown calms down a bit, but at any time of day or night it still feels 100% New York.
